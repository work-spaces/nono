> [!WARNING]
> This is an early alpha release that has not undergone comprehensive security audits. While we have taken care to implement robust security measures, there may still be undiscovered issues. We do not recommend using this in production until we release a stable version of 1.0.

> [!NOTE]
> :tada: v0.6.1 has shipped! :tada: we have completed work to separate the CLI from the core library!

AI agents get filesystem access, run shell commands, and are inherently open to prompt injection. The standard response is guardrails and policies. The problem is that policies can be bypassed and guardrails linguistically overcome.

Kernel-enforced sandboxing (Landlock/Seatbelt) blocks unauthorized access at the syscall level. Every filesystem change gets a rollback snapshot with integrity protection. Destructive commands are denied before they run. Secrets are injected without touching disk. When the agent needs access outside its permissions, a kernel-mediated supervisor intercepts the syscall via seccomp BPF, opens the file after user approval, and injects only the file descriptor — the agent never executes its own `open()`. No root or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` required. Runs on any Linux kernel 5.13+ — bare metal, containers(Docker,Podman,K8s), Firecracker, Kata.

## CLI

```bash
nono run --profile claude-code -- claude
nono run --read ./src --write ./output -- cargo build
```

Built-in profiles for [Claude Code](https://docs.nono.sh/clients/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://docs.nono.sh/clients/opencode), and [OpenClaw](https://docs.nono.sh/clients/openclaw) — or define your own with custom permissions.

## Library

The core is a Rust library that can be embedded into any application via native bindings. The library is a policy-free sandbox primitive -- it applies only what clients explicitly request.

```rust
use nono::{CapabilitySet, Sandbox};

let mut caps = CapabilitySet::new();
caps.allow_read("/data/models")?;
caps.allow_write("/tmp/workspace")?;

Sandbox::apply(&caps)?;  // Irreversible — kernel-enforced from here on
```

caps = CapabilitySet()
caps.allow_path("/data/models", AccessMode.READ)
caps.allow_path("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.READ_WRITE)

apply(caps)  # Apply CapabilitySet

```typescript
import { CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply } from "nono-ts";

const caps = new CapabilitySet();
caps.allowPath("/data/models", AccessMode.Read);
caps.allowPath("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.ReadWrite);

apply(caps);  // Irreversible — kernel-enforced from here on
```

## Features

### Kernel-Enforced Sandbox

nono applies OS-level restrictions that cannot be bypassed or escalated from within the sandboxed process. Permissions are defined as capabilities granted before execution -- once the sandbox is applied, it is irreversible. All child processes inherit the same restrictions.

| Platform | Mechanism | Minimum Kernel |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| macOS | Seatbelt | 10.5+ |
| Linux | Landlock | 5.13+ |

```bash
# Grant read to src, write to output — everything else is denied by the kernel
nono run --read ./src --write ./output -- cargo build
```

### Credential Injection

Two modes: **proxy injection** keeps credentials entirely outside the sandbox — the agent connects to `localhost` and the proxy injects real API keys into upstream requests. **Env injection** loads secrets from the OS keystore and injects them as environment variables before the sandbox locks.

```bash
# Proxy mode — agent never sees the API key, even in its own memory
nono run --network-profile claude-code --proxy-credential openai -- my-agent

# Env mode — simpler, but secret is in the process environment
nono run --env-credential openai_api_key --allow-cwd -- my-agent
```

### Agent SKILL Provenance and Supply Chain Security

Instruction files (SKILLS.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENT.MD) and associated artifacts such as scripts are a supply chain attack vector. nono cryptographically signs and verifies them using Sigstore attestation with DSSE envelopes and in-toto / SLSA style statements. It supports keyed signing (system keystore) and keyless signing (OIDC via GitHub Actions + Fulcio + Rekor). Upon execution, nono verifies the signature, checks the signing certificate against trusted roots, and validates the statement predicates (e.g. signed within the last 30 days, signed by a trusted maintainer).

Use the [nono-attest](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nono-attest) GitHub Action for signing direct within GitGub workflows. Users are then able to attest the files originate from the expected repository and branch, and were signed by a trusted maintainer.

### Network Filtering

Allowlist-based host filtering via a local proxy. The sandbox blocks all direct outbound connections — the agent can only reach explicitly allowed hosts. Cloud metadata endpoints and private network ranges are hardcoded as denied. DNS rebinding protection checks resolved IPs against the deny list before connecting.

```bash
nono run --supervised --proxy-allow api.openai.com --proxy-allow api.anthropic.com -- my-agent
```

### Supervisor and Capability Expansion

On Linux, seccomp user notification intercepts syscalls when the agent needs access outside its sandbox. The supervisor prompts the user, then injects the file descriptor directly — the agent never executes its own `open()`. Sensitive paths are never-grantable regardless of approval.

```bash
nono run --rollback --supervised --allow-cwd -- claude
```

### Undo and Snapshots

Content-addressable snapshots of your working directory taken before and during sandboxed execution. SHA-256 deduplication and Merkle tree commitments for integrity verification. Interactively review and restore individual files or the entire directory.

```bash
nono rollback list
nono rollback restore
```

### Composable Policy Groups

Security policy defined as named groups in a single JSON file. Profiles reference groups by name — compose fine-grained policies from reusable building blocks.

```json
{
  "deny_credentials": {
    "deny": { "access": ["~/.ssh", "~/.gnupg", "~/.aws", "~/.kube"] }
  },
  "node_runtime": {
    "allow": { "read": ["~/.nvm", "~/.fnm", "~/.npm"] }
  }
}
```

### Destructive Command Blocking

Dangerous commands (`rm`, `dd`, `chmod`, `sudo`, `scp`) are blocked before execution. Selectively allow or block additional commands per invocation.

```bash
$ nono run --allow-cwd -- rm -rf /
nono: blocked command: rm
```

> [!WARNING]
> Command blocking is defense-in-depth layered on top of the kernel sandbox. Commands can bypass this via `sh -c '...'` or wrapper scripts — the sandbox filesystem restrictions are the real security boundary.

### Audit Trail

Every session records command, timing, exit code, tracked paths, and cryptographic snapshot commitments as structured JSON.

```bash
nono audit show 20260216-193311-20751 --json
```
